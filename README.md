# GOENKAN-GAMERS
Comprehensive Python-based gaming system

This software project has been undertaken to develop a compiled multi-option, single-player gaming system’s functionalities onto one comprehensive program. 
Gaming, apart from honing instincts, fosters a sense of community. From jump ropes emerging from regular lengths of rope to hopscotch games haphazardly transcribed into dirt at the corner of ever playground and every neighborhood, humanity has always been entangled in the pursuit of, to put it simply, playing. Since its commercial birth in the 1950s as a technological oddity at a science fair, gaming has blossomed into one of the most profitable entertainment industries in the world.
The mobile technology boom in recent years has revolutionized the industry and opened the doors to a new generation of gamers. Indeed, gaming has become so integrated with modern popular culture that now even grandmas know what Angry Birds is, and the population of gamers, especially amongst the teenage demographic, has crescendo in recent years. 
While data illustrates that RPG (Real Player Games) or battle royale games have triumphed over other categories to be the most preferred form of gaming, we decided to produce a computerized version of games and recreationally activities traditionally played physically. In lieu of physical activity, most of our daily interactions have been translated to online platforms owing to the pandemic. These small yet crucial aspects of what life used to resemble in the before times has thus been similarly made available on a virtual platform. The games include: -

Magic 8 Ball 

Hangman

Tic Tac Toe

Rock Paper Scissors 

Archery (Special Emphasis Project: Sikkim-Delhi) 

Snake Game


We created each game through iterations and sequential structures in Python. The user plays against a machine opponent or in the case of Magic 8 ball, receives advice and guidance from a machine opponent. Particularly for the game of archery, we have devised options for the player regarding the difficulty of the game and the affiliations of the player, namely if the player belongs to Delhi or Sikkim. This personalization is left to the user’s will. 

During coding and design of the software Project, Python IDLE, as a powerful front-end tool is used for getting Graphical User Interface (GUI) based integrated platform and coding simplicity. Text files are utilized for back-end purposes in Hangman and Magic 8 Ball.
